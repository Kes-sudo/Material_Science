This repository contains code for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of amino-polysaccharide based biomaterials.
Common analysis include: phi/psi dihedrals, end-to-end distance, contour length, intra/inter chain hydrogen bonding, persistence length, hydration, diffusion and free energy of assembly
Scripts for parameterizing chitosan is also included
Scripts for running and analysing MD simulations of chitosan in the presence of an electric field in AMBER is also included (machine learning)
Scripts for analyzing PME All-atom CpHMD sinulations of chitosan is included
Scripts for preparing chitosan of different degrees and patterns of acetylation of acetylation based off x-ray diffraction data is included
