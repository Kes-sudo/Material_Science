This repository contains scripts for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of amino-polysaccharide self-assembly.
Common analysis include: phi/psi dihedrals, end-to-end distance, contour length, persistence length, hydration, P2 order parameter, hydrogen bonding and potential of mean force.
